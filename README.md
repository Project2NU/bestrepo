## Group 2 Project 2: Lit Library Reviews


![Alt text](/public/images/headerimg.png)

## User Story 
AS an avid reader and lover of beer, I WANT to read book reviews from others that share the same cross section of interest, SO that I can find good suggestions to expand my reading list, be entertained by witty drunken reviews, and join a community of like minded individuals so that I can leave my own reviews and interact with others. 


## Acceptance Criteria

It's done WHEN GIVEN a vistor to the site, that visitor can view the latest book reviews and pairing suggestions (or the most liked/commented). GIVEN a visitor desires to add their own content, WHEN they click the signup/create an account button/link to join the Library Libations Community, they can register as a reviewer/contributer to add books/reviews and interact with (comment or like/up vote or down vote) reviews from other users. Additionally, they will be able to see all of their own past reviews on their profile page.
